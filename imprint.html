              <strong>Disclaimer:</strong><br><br>
              <strong>Liability for Content</strong><br><br>
              The contents of our pages were created with utmost care. However, we cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of the contents. As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance with general laws pursuant to § 7 para.1 DDG. According to §§ 8 to 10 DDG, we are not obligated to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances indicating illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general laws remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard is only possible from the time of knowledge of a specific infringement. Upon becoming aware of such violations, we will remove this content immediately.<br><br>
              <strong>Liability for Links</strong><br><br>
              Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties over whose contents we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for these external contents. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the contents of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not recognizable at the time of linking. A permanent content control of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of an infringement. Upon notification of violations, we will remove such links immediately.<br><br>
              <strong>Copyright</strong><br><br>
              The content and works created by the site operators on these pages are subject to German copyright law. The duplication, processing, distribution, and any kind of exploitation outside the limits of copyright require the written consent of the respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of this site are only permitted for private, non-commercial use. Insofar as the content on this site was not created by the operator, the copyrights of third parties are respected. In particular, third-party content is marked as such. Should you nevertheless become aware of a copyright infringement, please inform us accordingly. Upon notification of violations, we will remove such content immediately.<br><br>
              <strong>Data Protection</strong><br><br>
              The use of our website is generally possible without providing personal data. Insofar as personal data (such as name, address, or email addresses) is collected on our pages, this is always done on a voluntary basis as far as possible. This data will not be disclosed to third parties without your explicit consent.<br>
              We point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g., communication by email) can have security vulnerabilities. Complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.<br>
              The use of contact data published within the scope of the imprint obligation by third parties for sending unsolicited advertising and information materials is hereby expressly prohibited. The operators of the pages expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the event of unsolicited sending of advertising information, such as spam emails.<br><br>
